# TxPy Jupyter Notebooks
Example Jupyter notebooks for the [TxPy library](https://github.com/strateos/transcriptic).

## Usage
Launch an interactive environment using 
- Remotely, via [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/strateos/transcriptic/master?urlpath=git-pull%3Frepo%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fgithub.com%252Fopen-strateos%252Ftxpy_jupyter_notebooks%26urlpath%3Dtree%252Ftxpy_jupyter_notebooks%252Findex.ipynb%26branch%3Dmain)
- Locally, via `jupyter notebook`. Ensure the library is accessible in your Jupyter python path, i.e. `pip install transcriptic[jupyter, analysis]`

## Layout
- [index.ipynb](index.ipynb) - Introductory notebook for this repository.
- [objects.ipynb](objects.ipynb) - Walkthrough of how to instantiate and utilize Jupyter objects (e.g. Run, Dataset, etc.) exposed in the library.
- [analysis.ipynb](analysis.ipynb) - Walkthrough of how to utilize the analysis package to interact with and perfor madditional analysis on exposed Datasets.
